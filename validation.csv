"The Evaluation of Somalia Information and Resilience Building Action Programme (SIRA).
**Title:** The Evaluation of Somalia Information and Resilience Building Action Programme (SIRA). **Organization:** Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), Embassy of Switzerland in Kenya. **Duration:** Between July and September 2022. **Number of days**: 30 days maximum. **Contract Type:** Consultancy. **Closing date: 26 June 2022.** **1. Purpose** This Terms of Reference (ToRs) provides the framework for the external **evaluation of the Somalia Information and Resilience Building Action Programme (SIRA).** SIRA aims to contribute to the improved resilience for agro-pastoral households through increased income from improved fodder value chains. In 2018, Switzerland developed a 9-year entry proposal with FAO – Somalia Information and Resilience Building Action (SIRA) – with a 10-months opening phase to concretely identify interventions that contribute towards a longer term resilience building of the Somalia communities and to provision of reliable data for decision making. In the current three-year phase, Switzerland contributes USD 6 Million to the Somalia Joint Resilience Action (JRA). JRA Framework was launched by WFP, UNICEF and FAO to contribute to resilience building in two regions in Somaliland (Awdal and Togdheer). The purpose of the evaluation is **to assess specific aspects of the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and lessons learnt of SIRA programme** in achieving its objectives. The evaluation will include transversal themes such as gender, good governance and conflict sensitivity programme management (CSPM) in the programme delivery and is expected to generate **learning and recommendations** for SDC and the relevant stakeholders. The evaluation is expected to also inform the planned next phase of the programme, and areas for enhanced synergies with other programmes in food security domain of the Swiss Regional Cooperation Programme for the Horn of Africa. **2. Context** Frequent natural disasters and conflicts have left Somali populations chronically food insecure. Recurrent droughts have severe impacts on the livestock sector that supports over 60% of the population in Somalia. The sector provides food, employment and incomes and contributes 40% of the GDP. Gender disparities in regards to income, access to resources and decision making power remain however important. Fodder is a key resource for Somali communities and their livestock, both in regards to income and prevention of drought-related emergencies. Despite the potential of the Somalia livestock sector, there are huge structural weaknesses that hamper the harnessing of its full potential. The availability of year-round affordable good quality feed and fodder is a key to improve animal quality, to mitigate lack of pasture and browse during droughts[\[1\]](#_ftn1) that lead to a large number of animal losses and resource based conflicts. In order to appropriately respond to disasters and shocks, a rigorous food security, nutrition and natural resources management information system is needed to provide timely, credible and locally owned analysis. **3. The Somalia Information and Resilience Building Action (SIRA)** SIRA aims at improving agro-pastoral livelihoods by focusing on fodder value-chain improvement, specifically support communities to enhance and sustain efficient fodder market systems. It will contribute to increased resilience in Somaliland through, enabling agro-pastoral communities to enhance and sustain efficient fodder production and fodder market system to absorb and adapt to shocks and stresses. It is aligned with the visions of the Somalia National Development Plan, 2017-2019 (NDP), the 2017-2020 United Nations in Somalia Strategic Framework (UNSF), and targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to implementation areas.

For applicants outside of Kenya, availability to travel to Kenya for up to two weeks technical advisory missions are expected. In this case travel costs (flight tickets and per diem) would be included in the contract in addition to the fees specified in Section 3.** ## 1. Context ### Technical context The African Union estimates that there are over 400 million people between the ages of 15 and 35 living in Africa. These young people are bright, full of ideas and potential. As the continent’s most important source of human capital, they are the future and deserve decent jobs. The growing digital economy across the continent offers opportunities for young people to fulfil their potential. Kenya’s young population continues to face socio-economic pressures as economic growth has not led to the creation of a sufficient number of (decent) jobs. Consequently, a major challenge currently facing young people in Kenya is youth unemployment, which stood at 38 per cent in 2019 according to the most recent Kenya Population and Housing Census report. Almost one in seven (13.7 per cent) young people in Kenya were Neither in Employment, Education or Training (NEET, SDG Indicator 8.6.1) as of 2016, with young women finding themselves around twice as often (18.2 per cent) in this group than young men (9.2 per cent). A further key constraint in the Kenyan youth labour market is a misalignment between labour supply (skills) and demand (jobs). The Kenyan education system, particularly at the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) level, faces a number of challenges including with regard to access, quality and infrastructure, while young people continue having limited opportunities to learn on the job, for instance through apprenticeships or internships. At the same time, the world is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. In recent years, forced displacement has increased in scale and complexity. While forcibly displaced persons face specific vulnerabilities, including psychological trauma, lack of opportunity and protection risks, host communities struggle to pursue their own development efforts in an environment that has been transformed by a large influx of newcomers. The responses to these challenges are becoming more focused on durable solutions to support more dignified, inclusive and comprehensive programmes for refugees and the communities that host them. The digital economy continues to emerge as a key driver for the creation of decent jobs especially for Kenya’s youth. The country has adopted the Digital Economy Blue Print of 2019 providing a framework to leverage digital government, digital business, infrastructure, innovation-driven entrepreneurship and digital skills and values. This also presents opportunities for refugees and host community members to access jobs in the digital labour market. Fully harnessing these opportunities requires to improve access to quality education and skills development as well as stimulating labour demand and access to digital labour markets within and beyond refugee camps. For young refugees to benefit from the transformative power of information and communication technologies (ICTs), they must be equipped with a range of digital skills and have affordable access to connectivity. ### Operational context of the assignment In response to the challenges facing both host communities and refugees, a new partnership initiative titled: **PROSPECTS Partnership for","[""Protection and Human Rights"",""Recovery and Reconstruction""]"

Este problema se deriva de una situación de altas tasas de violencia y percepción de inseguridad ciudadana; limitadas oportunidades de empleo, inequidad social, efectos del cambio climático e inseguridad alimentaria; estructuras estatales y gubernamentales débiles, etc. Las causas y efectos primarios de la migración en el trifinio coinciden con la situación general anteriormente descrita. El estudio de prefactibilidad detectó los siguientes retos específicos afectando el desarrollo territorial en la región del trifinio: - Limitadas oportunidades de empleo. - Inequidad social. - Inseguridad ciudadana. - Proceso de desertificación. - Inseguridad alimentaria y nutricional. - Deterioro de los servicios ecosistémicos debido al impacto del cambio climático. La población migrante y potencialmente migrante de esta región es predominantemente masculina y su edad oscila entre los 15 y 35 años. No obstante, hay un número significativo de mujeres migrantes, mayormente acompañadas de sus hijos menores y últimamente familias completas emigrando por la falta de perspectivas de permanencia. Ante esta situación, el proyecto propone contribuir a la reducción de las causas estructurales de la migración en la zona fronteriza del trifinio en Guatemala, Honduras y El Salvador. Para ello se considera importante reforzar las estructuras institucionales, aumentando la conciencia y la capacitad técnica del personal de gobiernos locales y de actores claves para el tema migratorio, el desarrollo, la planificación e implementación de políticas públicas de desarrollo integral; la creación de oportunidades y sistemas de apoyo para la formación ocupacional y nuevos emprendimientos, especialmente de jóvenes y mujeres.
