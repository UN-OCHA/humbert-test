"Coordinateur Projet Prise en charge de la Malnutrition Aiguë et Sévère (MAS) Kindu - Maniema - RDC - H/F
**ALIMA en RDC** ALIMA intervient en République Démocratique du Congo depuis août 2011 dans deux domaines relatifs à son expertise : la nutrition et la lutte contre les maladies épidémiques (choléra, rougeole et paludisme). Pour l’ensemble de ses programmes, ALIMA travaille en étroite collaboration avec les autorités sanitaires et administratives congolaises. A partir de 2013, ALIMA a décidé de concentrer l’ensemble de ses activités sur la lutte contre les maladies épidémiques, en développant un projet de Réponse aux Urgences en Santé et WASH (RUSH) spécifique aux épidémies de rougeole, de paludisme et de choléra. Il s’agit d’équipes d’intervention rapide pluridisciplinaires permettant de renforcer le système de surveillance, augmenter les capacités d’évaluation rapide et assurer la réponse aux urgences en fournissant des soins de santé et des services WASH. En 2015 ALIMA, toujours à travers ses projets RUSH, a répondu à l’importante flambée épidémique de rougeole fin 2015 dans l’ex-province du Katanga. ALIMA a participé, en coordination avec les autorités et les autres partenaires présents dans la zone, à la riposte vaccinale d’urgence. Ainsi, entre août 2015 et janvier 2016, plus de 285 000 enfants de 6 mois à 10 ans ont été vaccinés contre la rougeole. En 2016, ALIMA poursuit ses mêmes activités à travers le volet du projet RUSH dans l’ex-Katanga. Quatre interventions ont été menées et ont ainsi permis de prendre en charge 1 400 cas de choléra, plus de 800 cas de rougeole, plus de 30 000 cas de paludisme et de vacciner contre la rougeole plus de 149 000 enfants. L’année 2016 a été également marquée par une recrudescence des cas de choléra à l’échelle du pays. ALIMA a donc lancé une riposte choléra dans les provinces du Maniema, de la Tshopo et de la Mongala dès novembre 2016. De janvier à juillet 2017, ALIMA a mené également un projet d’accès aux soins de santé primaire dans la Zone de Santé d’Opienge (province de la Tshopo) pour les populations hôtes et les personnes déplacées par les conflits plus à l’Est. ALIMA a par ailleurs répondu à l’épidémie d’Ebola qui s’est déclarée en mai 2017 dans la province du Bas-Uélé en RDC. Enfin ALIMA a apporté plusieurs réponses aux flambées de choléra à travers le pays dans le Lomami, le Haut Lomami, le Kasaï et la région de Kinshasa. La mission RDC a aussi la spécificité d’avoir un projet de prise en charge des VBG. De mai à juillet 2018, ALIMA a apporté une réponse urgente à la neuvième épidémie Ebola dans la province de l’Equateur. **Situation récente :** Aujourd’hui, ALIMA a deux axes principaux d’intervention : - **Réponses aux épidémies et interventions d’urgence** Depuis 2018 et jusqu’au mois d’octobre 2020, ALIMA a mené un projet de réponse médico-nutritionnelle d’urgence dans la zone de santé de Kamwesha, dans la Province du Kasaï, visant à réduire la morbidité et la mortalité liées à la malnutrition aigüe et aux maladies de l’enfance chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans. ALIMA ayant également un volet de Recherche, elle y a intégré un projet de recherche innovant (OptiMa) visant à simplifier le traitement de la malnutrition aiguë. Depuis août 2018 et jusqu’au mois de juin 2020, les équipes ALIMA ont participé à la riposte contre la 10e épidémie d’Ebola en RDC, en prenant notamment en charge les malades dans les Centres de Transit Intégrés (CTI) et les Centres de Traitement Ebola (CTE) de Beni, Katwa et Mambasa, dans les provinces du Nord-Kivu et de l’Ituri. ALIMA est également intervenue dans la 11ème épidémie de la maladie à Virus Ebola, déclarée le 01 juin 2020 dans la Province de l’Equateur et terminée le 18 novembre 2020. Depuis le 07 février 2021, une 12e épidémie de MVE a été déclarée dans le Nord-Kivu, où ALIMA a mis en place 2 CUBES et un CTE dans la ZS de Biena.

**CONTEXTE** Radios Rurales Internationales est une organisation canadienne à but non lucratif qui depuis 1979 s’efforce de mettre à profit le pouvoir de la radio pour répondre au besoin des agriculteur.trice.s d’exploitations familiales. Nous travaillons avec plus de 1000 organisations de radio situées dans plus de 40 pays africains en vue de combattre la pauvreté et l’insécurité alimentaire. Grâce aux ressources et aux formations de RRI, nos partenaires de radiodiffusions fournissent des informations pratiques, pertinentes et d’actualité à des dizaines de millions d’Africain.e.s ruraux, y compris les agricultrices. Nous travaillons également avec plusieurs partenaires financiers pour la mise en œuvre de projets radiophoniques axés sur des défis particuliers liés au développement et des besoins exprimés par les communautés et l’obtention de résultats pour les agriculteur.trice.s et les populations rurales. Le changement climatique et la perte de la biodiversité sont deux crises environnementales majeures auxquelles le monde est confronté aujourd’hui. Les solutions basées sur la nature (SbN) sont devenues un outil novateur, quoiqu’indispensable pour relever ce défi. Le projet utilisera les émissions radiophoniques interactives locales appuyées par l’organisation pour renforcer l’action des communautés rurales en matière d’adaptation au changement climatique et de biodiversité au moyen de solutions basées sur la nature inclusives du genre, pertinentes à l’échelle locale. Le projet constituera un moyen pour les communautés locales (notamment les femmes et les jeunes) d’identifier et d’exprimer leurs besoins en termes d’adaptation; facilitera l’accès aux informations sur les SbN en Afrique subsaharienne; appuiera les communautés rurales dans l’apprentissage, la personnalisation et l’application des SCbN pour l’adaptation au climat; renforcera la sensibilité des politiques et des programmes aux besoins des communautés et sensibilisera les Canadien.ne.s et suscitera leur intérêt pour ces solutions. Le projet ciblera six pays, dont le **Burkina Faso**, la **Côte d’Ivoire**, l’**Éthiopie**, le **Ghana**, l’**Ouganda** et la **Zambie**. En guise de résultat ultime, le projet favorisera une meilleure intégration des femmes dans les communautés résilientes au changement climatique en Afrique subsaharienne. **OBJET DU CONTRAT** RRI est à la recherche de **deux (2) consultant.e.s** pour effectuer une analyse intersectionnelle sur l’égalité de genre et l’inclusion (ÉGI) au titre du projet SbN, dont un.e **(1) anglophone pour quatre pays (Éthiopie, Ghana, Ouganda et Zambie)** et un.e **(1) francophone pour deux pays (Burkina Faso et Côte d’Ivoire)** dans le cadre du lancement du projet afin de permettre à l’équipe de RRI d’élaborer une stratégie ÉGI. Cette étude portera sur les inégalités qui ont un impact sur la vie des populations dans chaque pays. Ces inégalités seront analysées en fonction de la manière dont elles structurent la pensée et les actions relatives aux SbN conçues et jugées pertinentes à l’échelle locale, ainsi que l’accessibilité et l’utilisation des moyens de communication, lorsqu’on sait qu’il y a un recoupement entre l’inégalité des genres et d’autres formes de discrimination qui renforce les obstacles à l’égalité et à l’inclusion. Les consultant.e.s travailleront avec les équipes de RRI dans chaque pays, ainsi que les équipes techniques ou spécialisées globales (ÉGI, SERA, etc.) pour finaliser la méthodologie de l’étude de synthèse largement basée sur une revue documentaire, effectueront l’analyse et animeront (ou préparer l’équipe pays pour la conduite) un atelier de validation dans chaque pays qui servira de base à la mise au point du rapport d’étude.

"Consultant(s), Gender Equality and Inclusion Analysis, Nature-based Climate Solutions (NBS) Project
**BACKGROUND** Farm Radio International is a Canadian organization that has been working since 1979 to harness the power of radio to meet the needs of small-scale farmers. We work with more than 1,000 radio organizations located in more than 40 African countries to fight poverty and food insecurity. With the benefit of FRI resources and training, our broadcasting partners deliver practical, relevant, and timely information to tens of millions of rural Africans, including women farmers. We also work with a range of funding partners to implement radio projects that address specific development challenges and community needs delivering results for farmers and other rural denizens. Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most defining environmental crises that challenge the world today. Nature-based climate solutions (NBS) have evolved as an innovative yet essential tool to address this challenge. The Project will use the Organization's interactive local radio programming to achieve enhanced rural community action on climate change adaptation and biodiversity using locally-relevant, gender-inclusive nature-based solutions. This Project will help local communities (particularly women and youth) to identify and express their adaptation needs, expand access to NBS information across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); support rural communities in learning about, customizing and applying NBS for climate adaptation; increase policy and program responsiveness to community needs, and raise Canadian awareness of, and engagement with these solutions. The Project will focus on six countries, including **Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia** with an ultimate outcome to improve gender-inclusive climate resilient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. **SCOPE OF WORK** FRI is seeking **two (2) consultants** to conduct an intersectional gender equality and inclusion (GEI) analysis for the NBS project - **one (1) anglophone covering 4 countries** (Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia) and **one (1) francophone covering 2 countries** (Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast) as part of the inception phase of the project in order for the FRI team to produce a GEI strategy. The study will focus on inequalities which impact people’s lives in each country. The inequalities will be analysed in terms of how they structure thinking and action on locally-developed and relevant NBS, and accessing and utilizing communication channels, recognising that gender inequality intersects with other forms of discrimination to compound barriers to equality and inclusion. The consultant will work with FRI’s teams in each country and the global technical/Specialty Teams (GEI, MERL, etc.) to finalize the largely desk-based review study methodology, and will conduct the analysis, as well as conduct (or prepare country team to conduct) a validation workshop in each country to support finalization of the study report. The analysis is envisioned with this limited scope given budget constraints.

En ese mismo sentido, los principales eventos se enmarcan en riesgos geológicos e hidrometeorológicos, resaltando los mismos en los últimos años. Cabe agregar, que los riesgos se han incrementado de manera notoria en fechas recientes, lo que, unido a la alta vulnerabilidad de la población, es propicio que, en las áreas de mayor impacto de estos eventos, ocurran situaciones que conduzcan a pérdidas de vidas humana, de producción e infraestructuras, con las consabidas consecuencias para el desarrollo del país. En cuanto a los efectos de los desastres naturales, es importante señalar que unos poseen mayor impacto en la infraestructura física del país. Por ejemplo, el terremoto del 1986 el país no estaba preparado para un evento de esta magnitud, según CEPAL (1999), generó que perdidas de infraestructura en San Salvador en edificios y casas de $264,890.3, que correspondió; a 20,860 casas dañadas, 7,500 casas destruidas y 4000 edificios de habitación dañados y otros daños a la infraestructura. También, la tormenta IDA en 2009, fuertes daños en la zona del volcán San Vicente, porque a pesar de una larga historia de flujos de escombros volcánicos en el flanco norte del volcán San Vicente, las comunidades estaban mal preparadas para los lahares que ocurrieron entre el 7 y el 8 de noviembre de 2009. Más de 250 personas fueron fallecidas por lahares resultantes de deslizamientos de tierra poco profundos, sin mencionar millones de dólares (EE. UU.). Asimismo, en daños a casas, agricultura, e infraestructura.

Al mismo tiempo, esto permite acceder a los registros históricos, establecer proyecciones, simulaciones, monitorear las áreas geográficas, modelar situaciones que impactan en la toma de decisiones. Igualmente, la Gestión Integral de Riesgos de Desastres (GIRD), constituye uno de los instrumentos fundamentales para disminuir el impacto de un evento natural adverso, es por eso que la misma tiene como función transmitir de generación en generación la experiencia histórico-social acumulada. En este mismo sentido, el desarrollo una planeación específica en Gestión de Riesgo de Desastres GRD, es una de las prioridades de la comunidad y se considera como una herramienta integral, cuya base será la concientización crítica, necesaria para la participación en la vida social.

MiracleFeet is a global nonprofit working to eliminate a leading cause of physical disability worldwide. Over two million children live with the severe consequences of a treatable birth defect known as clubfoot, and at least 175,000 more babies are born with it every year. Thanks to a non-surgical solution called the Ponseti method, 95 percent of cases can be fully treated for less than $500. Since 2010, MiracleFeet has scaled this proven, low-cost treatment to 30 countries where children previously had limited or no access to care. Still, today fewer than one in five children has access to treatment. Globally, our program focus regions include: West/Central Africa, East Africa, Asia, Latin America, & the Middle East and North Africa. Summary MiracleFeet seeks a Deputy Director of Programs (DDP) to play a key role in the strategic growth of clubfoot programs and program operations.

"Invitation to Bid - Third Party Monitoring in Northeast Syria
Cooperative Housing Foundation International is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) International NGO headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA. Cooperative Housing Foundation mission is to create long lasting, positive and community-led change that improves the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable people across the globe. Cooperative Housing Foundation international currently has programs in more than 27 countries around the world in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Sources of funding include the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Department of State, Department of Labor, and Centers for Disease Control, the United Nations, and private foundations. Our projects include: Economic Development, Financial Inclusion, Governance & Urban Management, Humanitarian Assistance, Food Security & Agriculture, Global Health, Civil Society & Capacity Development, Infrastructure & Construction, and Working with Women & Youth. With the Syrian conflict nearing its ninth year, 6.5 million people are food insecure, and 9 million are in need of food security assistance. Fighting has damaged agricultural lands and food production infrastructure, causing a significant drop in access to food, an increase in prices of agricultural inputs, and a reduction in livelihoods opportunities. The number of people at risk of food insecurity has remained between 8.7 and 10.5 million since 2017. According to the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), nearly half of Syrians spend an estimated 65% of their income on food, and 65% of food insecure households (HH) have adopted negative coping mechanisms related to food consumption. Global Communities (GC) has designed the 10-month, Assistance to Lives Across Syria (ATLAS) II program with the goal of addressing urgent humanitarian needs for 39,950 vulnerable, conflict-affected individuals in northeast Syria (NES). ATLAS II will reach the NES target by providing regular in-kind food assistance to 5,903 HHs and value vouchers to 868 HHs, for a total of 6,771 in-camp HHs served in four IDP camps. This goal directly aligns with BHA’s mission to save lives, alleviate human suffering, and reduce the physical, social, and economic impact of disasters through integrated multi-sector responses that are harmonized and coordinated with other actors in the field. Therefore, CHF International is seeking an independent contractor to collect monitoring data and serve as a means of triangulating data collected by CHF. The TPM (Third Party Monitoring) will conduct Summative Evaluation for Assistance To Lives Across Syria (ATLAS II) program activities in Northeast Syria, The contractor is expected to routinely collect monitoring data from the food assistance intervention to serve as a means of triangulating data collected by Cooperative Housing Foundation. The contractor is expected to: 1\. Observe food and voucher distribution activities 2\. Assess uptake, utilization and challenges with the complaints and feedback mechanisms adopted by; - Inspect food commodities’ quality at supplier warehouse(s), and - Facilitate laboratory testing of food samples prior to distribution, and - Undertake sample verification of beneficiaries from target locations and authenticate targeting and ration size allocation 3\.

"E-course Expansion: CPMS Standard 21 or 28
\[ You can download this vacancy notice as a PDF from [https://bit.ly/CCCM-FS](https://bit.ly/CCCM-FS) \] Organization: Save the Children Sweden Station: Remote Dates: July 4th - September 30th, 2022 (6 days) Application deadline: June 27, 2022 BACKGROUND Under the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, UNICEF and Save the Children co-lead the Working Group for the **Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action** (CPMS WG). The CPMS WG aims to strengthen quality and accountability in humanitarian child protection programming through the promotion, implementation and institutionalization of the child protection minimum standards. It currently has a 3 year initiative focusing on working across 4 prioritised sectors for children’s protection and well-being. The CPMS WG has developed a [free, introductory e-course](https://learning.alliancecpha.org/) based on the Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action with 4 mandatory modules and 14 optional ones. Its primary audience is child protection actors (in both humanitarian and non-humanitarian contexts), and other humanitarian colleagues (i.e. Education, WASH, Nutrition). Most users are in entry level positions (though ⅓ are at mid-level) and work at the country, regional or global level. Following the successful co-development of the module on Education and Child Protection with the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE), we wish to expand the course in partnership with other humanitarian sectors. OBJECTIVES Save the Children Sweden (on behalf of the CPMS Working Group) is looking for **A consultant in Food Security and** **A consultant in CCCM** to expand its e-course through the development of two separate **30 minute e-modules on Standards 21 (Food Security) and 28 (CCCM).** Joint applications will be accepted. SCOPE OF WORK It is expected that the consultants will work independently (though collaboration between consultants is encouraged where possible). Each consultant will be responsible for the development of one e-module (either food security or CCCM). They will be provided with a folder of introductory materials, such as case studies, templates, and strategy documents and will need to use them to design the modules, as well as complement them with assessment tools to enhance the learning experience.

"Connected Education Mapping Consultancy
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is offering a home-based Individual Consultancy with the Education Section, within the **Division of Resilience and Solutions**, and in collaboration with the Digital Service, within the **Division of External Relations**. UNHCR is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people. Every year, millions of men, women and children are forced to flee their homes to escape conflict and persecution. We are in over 125 countries, using our expertise to protect and care for millions. Off the heels of the SG’s Roadmap for Digital Transformation for the UN; UNHCR undertook the development of a unified digital transformation strategy for UNHCR, that moves the agency towards a framework that puts the needs of POCs at the forefront, involving them in solution design and building self-reliance. UNHCR’s Digital Strategy is led by Senior Leadership, and focuses on the achievement of two primary strategic objectives: Primary Objective One - Strengthen digital protection, inclusion and accountability, helping to build self-reliance of Persons of Concern. Primary Objective Two - Transform the way we work, creating efficiencies, sharing knowledge and increasing collaboration to strengthen our shared purpose. Connected Education is one component of the Digital Inclusion Chapter; building from our experience to-date; especially with a series of flag-ship programmes. This consultancy aims to support the regional benchmarking for Connected Education as part of the digital strategy. ## Organizational context UNHCR has committed to harnessing Connected Education to ensure refugees and host communities can meaningfully engage and benefit from today’s digital learning landscape, preparing them to fully participate in the world’s social and economic future. Owing to barriers of access and inclusion, refugee-hosting schools and communities are often not equipped with the digital skills, knowledge and resources needed to foster learners who can succeed in an increasingly digital world. COVID-19 has exacerbated pre-existing inequities and risks offsetting prior educational gains, particularly for the most marginalized learners, including refugee and displaced students. UNHCR advocates for the inclusion and prioritization of refugee-hosting schools into national digital learning initiatives, working within national development strategies to enhance education through technology. Government policies can be both enablers and obstacles for creating a positive environment for Connected Education. While many governments are putting in place digital transformation policies to ensure digital tools are used to enhance education quality, some States’ protective measures (for example limiting connectivity access in refugee hosting areas) can inadvertently hinder refugees from meaningfully accessing Connected Education. Aligned to UNHCR’s new Digital Transformation Strategy, this mapping exercise will start to determine benchmarks and help to create roadmaps for how greater digital inclusion and integration into national initiatives and digital priorities is possible. ## The position UNHCR is working to ensure refugee-hosting schools and communities are meaningfully included within all global and national connectivity and digital learning programmes planned between now and 2030. This position will work with UNHCR’s Digital Transformation team, including the Education Section, along with relevant Regional Bureaus, Country Offices, and Headquarters to create a picture of the Connected Education landscape and digital inclusion of refugees and displaced learners. ### Duties and responsibilities The consultant will be responsible for mapping the connected education landscape in relevant countries, undertaking an analysis of","[""Education""]"

"Consultant for Continuity in Crisis - Ensuring continuity of NCD care for crisis-affected populations in East Africa Feasibility Assessment
***Danish Red Cross is looking for a consultant to conduct a* *feasibility assessment to explore the potential to integrate NCD interventions into existing interventions in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia with a focus on areas such as disaster preparedness and response, health, resilience, mental health and psychosocial support and migrant/refugee projects.*** Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory diseases, diabetes and mental health conditions currently represent the fastest growing disease burden in Africa adding to the existing high burden of communicable diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS[\[1\]](#_ftn1). It is estimated that 34% of all deaths in Africa are caused by NCDs (WHO 2015). By 2030, NCDs will be the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa increasing from 28 to 46 percent of the total disease burden. In the Eastern African countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan and Uganda, 40% of all deaths on average are attributable to NCDs. Most of these deaths occur when people are in the productive age, causing economic hardship to families and countries. Furthermore, every year 703 000people take their own life and there are many more people who attempt suicide. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the fourth leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally in 2019. (WHO, 2021) In the Sub Saharan African, Cases of suicide and other Mental Health conditions have been on the rise and have become a major of grave concern. Migrants, refugees and internally displaced people (IDP) may face additional risks as they often do lack or have limited access to basic services including health and NCD care. It is estimated that East Africa and the Great Lakes Region currently hosts more than 4.7 million refugees and asylum seekers with almost 4 million residing in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Sudan (2021).2 The region thus hosts some 67 percent of the refugees on the African continent and 20 percent of the global refugee population. The largest number come from South Sudan, with significant arrivals from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. Most governments have generally continued to maintain open-door asylum policies by adopting progressive national refugee frameworks and promoting the inclusion of refugees into national health, education, and social protection/security systems. Disasters, particularly those associated with weather related hazards such as floods, storms and drought triggered 2.6 million new displacements during the year(2018). Conflict and disaster events caused by climate change in 2019 suggest that the number of displacements is likely to continue rising. Risks and vulnerabilities linked to disasters and conflict, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic-, have highlighted the importance of addressing health risks holistically while integrating comprehensive NCD care, both in humanitarian response and in efforts to strengthen health systems and reduce risks especially in contexts affected by crisis and disaster. There is an urgent need to ensure continuity of NCD care for vulnerable and marginalized crisis-affected populations without access to NCD care in Africa. The Danish Red Cross with funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, plans to implement a project that seeks to replicate NCD project experiences from Kenya and integrate them into relevant NCD interventions into DRC supported programmes in the East and Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia RC (ERCS) South Sudan RC (SSRC), Sudan RC (SRCS) and Somalia RC (SRCS).

The protection of civilians is continuously undermined and/or ignored by the parties to the conflict. Armed conflict, risk of famine and disease outbreaks in Yemen have resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with over 24 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. At the heart of this man-made humanitarian emergency is a protection crisis that threatens the life, safety and well-being of millions of civilians, not least the most vulnerable already struggling to survive. Underlying the armed conflict, deep financial and economy crisis, and collapse basic services and institutions, are ongoing violations of international human rights law (IHRL) and international humanitarian law (IHL) and that result in civilian casualties, displacement, damage to civilian infrastructure and disruption and loss of livelihoods. These factors have exacerbated the vulnerabilities of the Yemeni population, leading to families and individuals increasingly resorting to negative coping mechanisms, such as child marriage, child labor, forced recruitment, etc. Moreover, there is an increased family separation and the breakdown of community support structures, not to mention increased psychosocial and mental distress. **General purpose of the position** - Support the development of new projects/programs proposals through technical inputs to and feedbacks about the project/program methodology and approaches - According to identified needs and resources available, deliver training, workshops, seminars to national and international staff on GBV and CP related issues, data protection protocols, PSS (individual case management and collective PSS) with the aim of ensuring quality and accountability standards are met across the mission’s protection program. - Keeps the relationship with the Protection (and other relevant) Cluster(s) at National and Hubs level: ensures active participation and attendance to meetings, ensure INTERSOS’ role as key protection partner and ensure accurate/timely inputs and reporting. - Ensures implementation and consistency of INTERSOS’ global SOPs and further integrate them by developing SOPs at mission level, adapted to context and reality.

"HIV and Mental Health: Baseline Survey in Mombasa
**Background and Context** Triggerise in Kenya, through the Tiko platform, uses an ecosystem implementation approach to enable beneficiaries between the ages of 15-19 to access SRH services at a subsidized cost where they earn tiko miles redeemable at a tiko vendor through the purchase of goods after every service uptake. Triggerise received funding from the Elton John Foundation (EJAF) to implement these interventions for adolescents aged between 15-24. Access to Mental Health (MH) services, and HIV related services including: testing, PrEP, and ART in Mombasa. This programme will focus on young people in their diversity aged 15-24 with a particular focus on adolescent girls and young women, young people living with HIV and key populations such as those who inject drugs, those engaged in sex work and men who have sex with men and will work to address key barriers in accessing HIV prevention and treatment services and MH services that these groups face when navigating through the private and public sectors. The ITH platform is designed to support users through complex healthcare journeys utilizing community mobiliser and CSO support, reminders, rewards and follow up calls to motivate adherence, and tracking users to support their sustained use of health services. The programmes aim to improve young people’s access to contraception, Mental Health, ART, HIV and PrEP services in order to improve the following poor outcomes among this age cohort and groups: Modern Contraceptive Prevalence rates which is at 44%. As part of this work, Triggerise will engage an external, local evaluator to co-design and conduct an independent mixed-methods evaluation. The aim is to understand the social and demographic characteristics of Tiko users, and to investigate the complex intersection of MH, ART, HIV and PrEP outcomes by evaluating the impact of the platform on user knowledge, awareness, attitudes and behaviors (uptake of services) over time. The specific approach will be a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods that will be used to understand the change in these indicators. Ultimately, we will model impact on HIV prevalence rates and MH prevalence rates (focusing on stress, depression and anxiety) in Mombasa, as compared to other comparable urban areas with a focus on KPs (Key Populations). The evaluation will also seek to assess perceptions around HIV, ART, PREP and MH, and how these contribute to societal stigmas around KPs and other vulnerable populations. The EJAF programme aims to achieve the below outcomes among young women and young men aged 15-24 in Mombasa: The goal of this project is to increase the social empowerment of young people living in Mombasa, which we expect to lead to improved and sustained mental and sexual health. Outcomes include: 1\. Young people have improved and sustained mental and sexual health 2\. Young people have improved agency and quality of care in their options of service providers 3\. Increased awareness for MH and HIV programmes among Government of Kenya (GoK) 4\. Improve the quality of HIV and MH services available on the Triggerise’s Tiko platform 5\. Reduce barriers to access HIV and MH services. 6\. Assess the availability, accessibility, affordability, and recent uptake of HIV and MH services among the target group of vulnerable young women and men aged 15-24. 7\. Unpack the knowledge, practices and attitudes towards HIV (including on PrEP)and MH services 8\. Identify factors affecting access to HIV and MH services including: socioeconomic, cultural, and political situations and identify potential solutions 9\.

"Consultancy on Latin America Regionalisation Initiative
1. **CONSULTANCY ASSIGNMENT BACKGROUND** NRC in the Latin America (LA) region has grown significantly in the last couple of years, nearly representing 49% of the 2021 AELA actuals. The growth in financial volume and in the number of people reached has been coupled with a significant geographical expansion, leading to the establishment of many new offices, including in new countries. The AELA regional structure has been initially established to manage a single country office in LA. As part of the separation from the Central and West Africa & Latin America Region in early 2019, it was considered to establish Latin America as a separate Regional Office, but the conclusion was that the financial perspectives at that time were not sufficient to sustain a regional setup. In August 2019, the AELA Regional Office (RO) initiated an external assessment aimed at giving an objective view of how external trends and developments will influence the situation in Latin America in the next 3-5 years. Some of the key recommendations and ways forward included: - The establishment of a Country Office set up for the North of Central America and Mexico (NCA&M) managed by a Country Director (CD) and a Country Management Group (CMG) based in Honduras. This structure has been created in January 2021 and is responsible for programming in Honduras and El Salvador as well as expansion into Mexico and Guatemala. - The establishment of a senior representation position in Panama. This position was created in January 2021 and had responsibility for representation, fundraising efforts and advocacy on behalf of the RO and the three country offices in the region (Colombia, Venezuela and NCA&M). This position was implemented through an own funds support from Field Operation (FO) but was finally discontinued at the end of 2021 due to lack of financial resources and de-prioritization. - Gradually look into having regional functions dedicated fully or partially to Latin America (LA) to be hosted in LA, maintaining existing reporting lines to the Regional Office based in Oslo. As of April 2022, the following positions are fully or partially dedicated to LA and/or based in LA: - 5 RO Staff are fully dedicated to LA including: one Regional Finance Controller (based in Bogota); one Regional Corporate Adviser (based in Bogota), one Regional Investigator for Latin America (based in Bogota), one Regional Risk and Compliance Coordinator (based in Cali, Colombia) as well as one Senior Sub-Regional Adviser based in Spain. - 2 AELA staff are currently based in LA but do not exclusively support LA countries: Regional Access Adviser (based in Panama) and regional Protection Of Civilians (POC) adviser (based in Colombia). Maintaining NRC operations in Latin America in the medium term, and possible geographical expansion, requires both direction from NRC HO and dedicated regional attention. As stated in AELA Regional Strategy 2022-2025, in order to respond at scale to the increasing humanitarian needs in LA, the AELA RO has the ambition of establishing a full regional structure. It is foreseen that this regionalization process will be phased throughout the entire strategic period and contingent on organizational approval. For that purpose, AELA RO committed to conduct in 2022 an analysis of the main needs and priorities (programme, advocacy and support) and related financial implications/cost analysis to help shape the needed structure to ensure relevant support and oversight to priorities in Latin America. 1. **OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK** **Objectives** The objective of this work is threefold: 1. Assess the main gaps, needs and priorities in terms of regional programme, advocacy and support functions for Latin America (LA) 2.

"Evaluation of Education Inclusion in IGAD Member States
In December 2017, the Government of the Republic of Djibouti, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the European Union (EU), and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), convened a regional ministerial meeting in Djibouti on refugees, returnees and the host community. At the meeting, IGAD ministers in charge of education resolved to take collective responsibility to ensure that every refugee, returnee and member of host communities has access to quality education in a safe learning environment within their respective countries without discrimination. These commitments are expressed in the Djibouti Declaration on Regional Refugee Education, to which an Action Plan is annexed, which outlines the actions to be carried out in the delivery of quality education and learning outcomes for refugees, returnees, and host communities in the region. The Djibouti Declaration emphasized on five key strategic interventions: 1. Inclusion of refugees and returnees into national education systems with a multi-year costed plan of action. 2. Higher Education and Technical Vocational Education and Training/ post-secondary skills and competencies. 3. Regional Qualifications Framework 4. Accreditation and Certification of Education 5. Resource Mobilization and Partnership The 2017 Djibouti Plan of Action stipulates the actions under this commitment as follows. 1. Determination of the status of integration of education of refugees and returnees into Education Sector Plans of Member States. 2. Mapping existing initiatives, proposals and activities to integrate the education of refugees and returnees into Education Sector Plans by 2020. 3. Supporting activities that lead to the integration of refugees and returnees into National Education systems. 4. Strengthening EMIS data collection to include the needs of refugees and returnees 5. Fully integrate into the national education systems schools for refugees, including all those residing in urban areas, camps, and settlements. **Rationale and reasons for the evaluation** Five years have passed since the initial commitments were made during the Djibouti Declaration conference. Since then, IGAD has organised annual stocktaking meetings with IGAD member states and/or the Core Partners, which has included discussions and updates on the inclusion of refugees and progress made. Some countries have made more progress than others towards their commitments and valuable lessons can be drawn that may benefit all signatories as efforts continue towards implementation of joint commitments. In addition, ahead of launching the monitoring framework which will be implemented by all Member States with standardised indicators, it is a good moment to document status quo, progress, and achievements, and determine what factors have allowed some countries to progress at a faster pace than others to support the fulfilment of the commitments made by all member states. **Objectives** This formative evaluation is commissioned for both learning and accountability purposes to contribute towards strategic reflections and: - - Document progress and achievements at country level and critically assess and analyse drivers of and obstacles to progress, identify good practices and draw recommendations and lessons that may inform future planning and implementation in relation to the joint commitments made. - Establish what conditions and type of environment (political/financial/humanitarian) that enable countries to move up the continuum scale for education inclusion, and what role partners such as IGAD, UN, INGOs and Donors play to this end. Against this background, the evaluation will combine features of a Process Evaluation as it sets out to establish *how* outcomes are generated and obstacles and drivers with an","[""Education""]"

"GPF Minimum Proficiency Standards Specialist Job Description
The Leading through Learning Global Platform (LTLGP) project, implemented by Education Development Center (EDC) is seeking a professional with experience in primary-level reading and/or mathematics instruction, student assessment, and professional development to act as aMinimum Proficiency Review Specialist (MPR Specialist). This position is intended to advance the Minimum Proficiency Review process envisioned as part of [the Global Proficiency Framework ](https://youtu.be/GBubZJTbX1U)(GPF). The GPF describes the global minimum proficiency levels expected of students in grades one to nine in reading and mathematics. The four levels outlined in the GPF—Below Partially Meets, Partially Meets, Meets, and Exceeds Global Minimum Proficiency—form a common scale from low to high achievement. To develop the GPF, USAID worked closely with the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home), [UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)](http://gaml.uis.unesco.org/policy-linking/), UK's Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), [Australian Council for Education Research (ACER)](https://www.acer.org/au/), and [the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) to convene experts from around the globe and create a single set of global standards for reading and mathematics. As part of the GPF, the Minimum Proficiency Review process will allow relevant stakeholders to assess a country’s existing reading and mathematics proficiency benchmarks and data in an effort to map them to, and establish a process for aligning with, the GPF standards. The MPR process will allow teams to identify gaps in a selected education component (such as curricula, materials, training materials, assessments, and policies), and provide the Ministry of Education with specific recommendations to remediate these gaps Over the next 2 years, USAID will advance the process of MPR development through separate activities with the DEEP mechanism (implemented by a separate USAID contractor) and LTLGP. The following list describes the full set of planned activities, with those included in LTLGP’s scope of work highlighted in bold: - develop guidance for the MPR process; - develop and conduct introductory webinars on the GPF and MPR for missions and the wider public; - translate the GPF into two languages; - conduct annual refresher webinars; - integrate GPF and MPR information into USAID C3 training modules; - develop a video on GPF and the MPR process; - designate specialists able to provide support to Missions and/or partners that express interest in the MPR - track and share data on Mission and Partner demand for the MPR - identify countries where Missions will conduct MPRs, then support the MPR process in those countries; publish fact sheets on each MPR use case as well as a summary lessons learned document; - track recommendations for updates and changes to the MPR process; - develop and implement an MPR Specialist training course so that a broader cadre of experts is available to support the MPR process globally; - communicate about the GPR and MPR process to the wider education community.

Une grande majorité de la population n’a pas accès aux services de base tels que l’eau potable, l’électricité, assainissement et couverture maladie. De plus, Haïti est vulnérable par rapport aux désastres naturels. Il est considéré comme le cinquième pays le plus exposé aux catastrophes naturelles. Le pays a subi en moins de dix ans plus de quatre catastrophes majeures dont il a encore du mal à se relever : le tremblement de terre de 2010, la tempête tropicale Isaac et l’ouragan Sandy en 2012, l’ouragan Matthew en 2016, les ouragans Irma et Maria en 2017.

Au-delà de ces facteurs, l’insécurité alimentaire est conduite par la pauvre performance du secteur agricole combinée à la forte dépendance des importations de produits alimentaires (plus de la moitié des produits alimentaires présents sur le marché) notamment pour le riz (83%). Les prix des produits sont largement influencés par les défis logistiques, des coûts de production élevé, des structures de marché précaires et des taux d’inflation élevés ces dernières années. Les derniers résultats de l’IPC (Cadre Intégré de Classification de la Sécurité Alimentaire) présentés en aout 2020 rapportent que 4.4 millions de personnes ont besoin d’une assistance alimentaire en Haïti (dont 1 156 915 personnes se trouvent en IPC 4 – Urgence) pour la situation projetée de Mars à juin 2021. Ces résultats inquiétants sont liés en grande partie à la crise politique installée dans le pays depuis juillet 2018 et qui l’a entrainé dans une crise économique et sociale. Les différents épisodes de « peylok » ont perturbé les marchés entrainant une instabilité dans la disponibilité des produits de base mais surtout des épisodes inflationnistes. La fluctuation de la monnaie a accentué cette inflation impactant l’accès monétaire des ménages aux produits de base. Par ailleurs il existe une crise agro-climatique avec des poches importantes de sècheresse installées dans le pays qui a provoqué une diminution significative de la production agricole. En plus, la crise liée au COVID-19 au niveau mondial et la déclaration de l’urgence sanitaire décrétée par le Gouvernement en mars 2020 a entraîné davantage de personnes dans l’insécurité alimentaire avec un impact sur les marchés, les mouvements des personnes et les moyens d’existence des ménages vulnérables, entre autres. Face a la dégradation de la situation de sécurité alimentaire dans le pays, le bureau du PAM en Haiti développe plusieurs activités dont des réponses d’urgences, de filets sociaux, de résilience.

The mission of WFP is to help the world achieve Zero Hunger in our lifetimes. Every day, WFP works worldwide to ensure that no child goes to bed hungry and that the poorest and most vulnerable, particularly women and children, can access the nutritious food they need. WFP supports the Government of Haiti, in collaboration with partners, United Nations agencies, civil society and private sector to achieve ""Zero Hunger"", implement the 2030 Agenda and contribute to reach the Sustainable Development Goals #2 (Zero Hunger).

"Request for Proposals- SEED Project Baseline Evaluation - Jordan
**CONSULTANT TERMS OF REFERENCE:** **‘Supportive Educational Engagement for Development (SEED)’ BASELINE STUDY** 1. **RIGHT TO PLAY** Established in 2000, Right To Play is an international non-governmental organization committed to improving the lives of children and youth affected by conflict, disease, and poverty. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Right To Play is active in 15 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and has fundraising offices in six European and north American countries. Pioneering its innovative child-centered, play-based learning methodology, Right To Play works across the five key outcome areas of quality education, peaceful communities, health and well-being, gender equality, and child protection. Right To Play has been active in the education and sports for development sectors in Jordan since 2006, training teachers in UNRWA and Ministry of Education schools as well as coaches in local communities to provide engaging interactive sessions that utilize games and sports to promote psychosocial wellbeing, education and gender equality. . Vulnerable Jordanian, Palestinian, and Syrian children who take part play days and tournaments organized by Right To Play are more engaged in school and have vastly improved life skills. In turn, the youth with whom Right To Play works achieve higher grades, experience greater levels of cooperation and cohesion, and are empowered to overcome trauma, adversity, and cultural stigmas to fulfil their dreams. All RTP projects are gender-responsive, placing particular emphasis on female empowerment. They are also usually supported by a sustainable rehabilitation component whereby school classrooms and play spaces are renovated, football pitches are constructed within underserved communities, or students lead maintenance initiatives within their schools. In 2019, RTP reached a total of 102,848 Jordanian, Palestinian, and Syrian children and youth in schools across Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Mafraq, and Aqaba. In addition, the organization currently has 2,904 active teachers and coaches, having trained 766 this year. 1. **‘Supportive Educational Engagement for Development (SEED)’** School closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have placed a considerable burden on the Jordanian education system and caused learning losses among students. The impact of school closures is compounded by pre-existing challenges, including the 2019 teacher strikes and an already overburdened and under-funded education system. Although the Ministry of Education (MoE) launched an online strategy, limited access to basic ICT infrastructure, connectivity and electricity has hampered learning in the country’s most remote areas and among vulnerable communities. The SEED project, funded by Walter Haefner Stiftung, aims to **Help vulnerable community youth overcome learning and developmental challenges resulting from COVID-19 through the provision of supportive educational services, positive learning environments, and play-based learning.** The project selected 12 community centers (1 CBO in each governorate per year) on the basis of a needs assessment exercise as well as criteria set by, and recommendations from the Ministry of Youth and RTP. Through SEED, Right To Play will train a total of 48 teachers 16 teachers per year who will conduct the remedial classes in CBOs, covering the subjects, English, mathematics, Arabic and science.

**NUTRITIOUS FOODS FINANCING FACILITY-N3F TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY** ISSUANCE DATE: June 1st, 2022 CLOSING DATE: July 1st, 2022 PROJECT SUMMARY The Nutritious Foods Financing Facility (N3F or ‘the Facility’), comprising Fund and Technical Assistance Facility, seeks to exploit market-based solutions that support GAIN’s overall goal to advance nutrition outcomes by improving the consumption of nutritious and safe food for all people, especially those most vulnerable to malnutrition. N3F is a pioneering, nutrition-focused investment facility developed to scale up affordable nutritious foods in emerging markets and among vulnerable consumers. N3F is an important extension of GAIN’s programs, targeting small- to medium-sized enterprises throughout Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) that scale up production and distribution of locally produced nutritious foods. Further, the N3F aims to have a demonstration effect showing that nutrition and nutritious foods are an investable and commercially viable investment theme. The N3F will, therefore, play an important part of GAIN’s broader objective to influence other major finance actors to invest in nutrition. As a complement to the financial support provided by the debt fund, a technical assistance facility (TAF) provides valuable capacity-building support to SMEs. This capacity building, administered through the TAF, will help de-risk the investments and ensure that the supported companies produce safe, nutritious foods that meet GAIN’s criteria and that are in line with local regulations and global best practices for the production and marketing of safe, nutritious foods. Based on the outcomes of an initial business needs assessment, GAIN will recommend a package of TA for the SME which may include general business development services (for business planning, strategy development, financial and business management) and/or specialized TA pertaining specifically to the production of safe and nutritious foods. N3F is prioritizing SSA countries with a robust pipeline of SMEs. **These include Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Guinea, Niger, Ivory Coast and Senegal.** EXPRESSION OF INTEREST GAIN therefore invites prospectus from competent firms and individuals to offer high quality technical assistance to support selected investee SMEs under the N3F program. The shortlisted service providers will be incorporated into a database and will be contacted to submit proposals on an as-needed basis. This is an expression of interest aimed at refreshing and broadening the database of service providers. Service Providers will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the N3F program objectives as well as GAIN’s mission, working in close cooperation with the TAF and GAIN program staff. The consultants will be expected to travel to the business premises of the investee SMEs for project implementation, make evaluations and analysis, deliver high quality and practical technical assistance packages, draft reports, and recommendations. This EOI specifically targets technical experts with experience in providing consulting services in; - Food safety and quality management, including supply chain management (e.g. training of supplier smallholder farmers), logistics and distribution, gap assessment for certifications and implementation of standards, and post-harvest loss management - Product development, formulation and process engineering and optimization - Market development, including marketing, advertising, distribution, and sales - Achieving business scale - Financial management - Corporate governance - Business processes optimization including documentation and digitalization - Environmental resource and waste management, including environmental impact assessment - Gender equality and equal employment opportunities ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA -","[""Food and Nutrition""]"

Handicap International/Humanity & Inclusion (HI) is an independent and impartial international solidarity organization, which intervenes in situations of poverty and exclusion, conflicts and disasters. Working alongside people with disabilities and vulnerable populations, it acts and speaks out to meet their essential needs, improve their living conditions and promote respect for their dignity and fundamental rights. More info: [www.hi.org](http://www.hi.org) HI is committed to an employment policy in favour of persons with disabilities. **JOB CONTEXT:** **INFORMATION ON THE CONTEXT OF THE MISSION** Despite the different conflicts in between of insurgencies and internal conflicts affecting the country in Centre and North of Mozambique the security is still fairly good. The living conditions are excellent. Mozambique in particular in the area of interventions are very welcoming and life for foreigners is generally quite comfortable. The position is based in the permanent Maputo City Programme covering 3 regions South, Centre and North, which implies probably field missions to the different provinces of countries under the conditions of security procedures established by HI, that have to be strictly followed. In Cabo Delgado, security, social and economic well-being of population have all been severely affected and a high number of persons (over 700,000) are internally displaced across the Province. The resilience of those population is steadily reducing, as individuals and communities are facing uncertainty regarding their day base living, with limited capacity of the authorities and relevant institutions to respond to their needs. This combination of factors results in protracted psychosocial distress, and resilience, and eventually increases mental health disorders amongst individuals - which in turn affects the community as a whole. The healthcare system in Cabo Delgado in the affected areas, is one of the hardest hits, having deteriorated to the point of collapse. Ongoing challenges include increased rates of chronic illness, disability and access to essential services such as medicine and rehabilitation, MHPSS services. Hospitals struggle to absorb the number of patients and to cope with a lack of resources, including a shortage of staff and essential medicines and supplies. In zone of conflicts, local populations, internally displaced persons and returning populations are all at risk. The identification of the most vulnerable individuals, including people with disabilities, and the rapid response to essential needs is a priority for the humanitarian community working throughout Cabo Delgado. The political conflict and humanitarian crisis are likely to continue well over 2021; whilst at the same time continue to hamper the delivery of primarily health and socio-economic services, complicating access and increasing the vulnerability of the general population. **DESCRIPTION OF THE MISSION** The thirty years’ presence of HI in Mozambique can be divided in 3 key periods: - From 1986 to 1997: core action of HI on physical rehabilitation; - From 1997 to 2014: core action of HI on demining activities with a range of short/mid-term actions on inclusion & DPOs - From 2013: progressive shift to VA and Social Protection with still large demining action up to 2015 Humanity and inclusion Mozambique is on its end implementation of country programme Strategy: 2021-2023 Emergency, and development sectors coexist in Mozambique, creating a diverse, and dynamic working environment, where coordination is operated mainly through working groups and clusters.

"Consultancy service for conducting midterm review of Health Systems Strengthening Project in Sudan - EU funded.
**Executive Summary** GOAL has been responding to a wide range of humanitarian and development needs in Darfur since 2004 and is currently supporting the provision of primary healthcare services in 17 facilities across Kutum and Al-Waha localities, North Darfur. To response to the changing security and political context in Sudan, GOAL has developed HealthPro project to promote durable solutions for displacement-affected communities, as well as long term access to quality health services. The project is designed to strengthen the capacity of the decentralized health system in North Darfur to provide sustainable services in the target localities of Kutum, Serf Umra and Umbaro in North Darfur, by increasing the quality of, and demand for, services. Activities range from infrastructure rehabilitation and financial support to the health system, to improving monitoring and supervision, quality assurance, data collection for enhanced planning and decision making. It links top-down approaches, via health systems strengthening, with bottom-up approaches via community systems strengthening, in order that demand, access and quality of health service provision and delivery are optimized. **Project Background** HealthPro is a project funded by the European Union Trust Fund and aims to build capacity of the North Darfur State Ministry of Health (SMoH), the LHDs of Kutum, Umbaro and Serf Umra, 10 PHC facilities, and community structures within the catchment areas of the health facilities for a sustained delivery of health services in the areas. In addition, the project provides targeted reproductive health support to Serf Umra Rural Hospital to strengthen the referral linkages with the PHC facilities in the locality. HealthPro employs a health system strengthening (HSS) approach whereby project stakeholders jointly conduct capacity-building while gradually transitioning all health system functions of the targeted localities and facilities to the government. Ensuring the LHDs have infrastructure, resources, and systems in place, linkage of the health facilities to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), training health workers and managers, and infrastructure and equipment support to the health facilities and the National Medical Supplies Fund (NMSF) are among the key project interventions at the level of institutions. Improving the Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) to strengthen planning, decision-making and resource allocation in the decentralized system is another focus area of the project. In terms of governance and accountability, HealthPro aims to ensure the three LHDs have qualified and skilled staff, infrastructure, facilities, systems, and tools to own the management of health service delivery in their locality. In addition, the project strengthens existing community-level social accountability mechanisms through capacity building and support to Community Health Committees (CHCs) with the aim to promote strong relationships between the target communities and service providers and ensure that services are shaped by feedback from users and are responsive to their needs. In relation to healthcare financing, HealthPro promotes increased access to health insurance provided by the NHIF and financial risk protection, initially through financial support for premiums and other health system costs, while linking the poorest of the poor to community groups and social funds to promote sustainable financing of these costs. In addition, the project supports the establishment and registration of Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) to enhance the capacity of community members to pay for insurance. Thus, the project enables vulnerable households to access high quality health services through a sustainable system, while avoiding financial hardship.
