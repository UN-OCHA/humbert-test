"ÉVALUATION EXTERNE DU PROGRAMME ABRIS ET HABITAT DE NRC EN RCA
1. Informations générales 2. 1. Contexte Bien que riche en ressources naturelles telles que l'uranium, l'or et les diamants, la République Centrafricaine est l'un des plus pauvres au monde. En 2013, le pays a été plongé dans une guerre civile qui a mis plus de la moitié des 4,9 millions d'habitants du pays dans le besoin d'une aide humanitaire. Les violences déclenchées en décembre 2020 ont inauguré des dynamiques conflictuelles nouvelles inédites tel que les engins explosifs, de nouveaux acteurs sur le terrain et des zones autrefois épargnées qui ont sombré dans la violence. Cette insécurité a entraîné des nouveaux épisodes de déplacements et aggravé la situation déjà précaire de millions de Centrafricains. La recrudescence de la violence armée et la récession de l’économie centrafricaine ont plongé plus de la moitié de la population, soit 3,1 millions de personnes, dans une grande vulnérabilité. Parmi elles, 2,2 millions ont des besoins sévères qui exigent une réponse d’urgence. Depuis novembre 2021, le nombre d’incidents et clashs entre les Forces armées centrafricaines (FACA) et groupes armés est en augmentation et les nouveaux déplacements sont dus aux attaques des positions des groupes armés par les FACA et forces bilatérales dans plusieurs localités, et quelques fois de la peur de représailles (voire des représailles avérées) sur certaines populations soupçonnées d’être en intelligence avec une des parties au conflit. Ces affrontements aggravent la situation et certaines personnes sont obligées de se déplacer à titre préventif pour trouver refuge dans des lieux plus sûrs. Au 30 avril 2022, le nombre total des personnes déplacées internes (PDI) en RCA a été estimé à 658 000 individus. L’accès humanitaire reste une préoccupation majeure, avec des incidents contre des travailleurs humanitaires enregistrés tous les mois. 1. 1. Activités et présence de NRC NRC travaille en République Centrafricaine depuis 2014 à travers les programmes Abri & Habitat, WASH, Moyens d'existence et sécurité alimentaire (LFS), Éducation, et Information, conseil et assistance juridique (ICLA). La compétence clé Abri & Habitat est fortement intégrée avec la compétence clé WASH en RCA, et elles sont toutes les deux gérées par une même équipe WASH-Shelter. L’équipe ICLA soutient également l’équipe Shelter en RCA à travers l’obtention de titres fonciers viables afin de sécurises les abris fournis par NRC sur le plan légal. Le programme NRC Shelter cible les réfugiés, les personnes déplacées, les rapatriés et les ménages vulnérables des communautés d'accueil qui ont besoin d'une aide au logement pour améliorer leurs conditions de vie dans les lieux de mise en œuvre de NRC. Une attention particulière est accordée aux ménages qui répondent aux critères de vulnérabilité suivants : - Les personnes déplacées et les réfugiés vivant dans des camps de fortune dont les abris les exposent aux intempéries ; - Les personnes déplacées et les réfugiés vivant dans des communautés d'accueil où la compétition est forte pour le peu d'espace disponible et partagent les espaces de couchage ; - Les rapatriés (anciennes personnes déplacées), dont les maisons ont été vandalisées ou détruites en raison de la crise ; - Les écoles dans les zones touchées par le conflit qui sont utilisées comme logements collectifs par les communautés déplacées. Le ciblage des bénéficiaires vise également à atteindre les ménages les plus vulnérables sur la base de critères de sélection préétablis, acceptés par la communauté. La priorité sera donnée aux ménages dirigés par des femmes, aux mineurs non accompagnés, aux ménages dirigés par des enfants et aux ménages dont les membres sont handicapés. Le fait d'avoir des critères de sélection clairs permettra aux bénéficiaires méritants d'avoir un accès équitable à l'aide au logement du NRC, et donc d'atténuer le risque de tensions si l'aide","[""Shelter and Non-Food Items""]"

TGH is currently operating in 11 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. **Context** On February 24, the Russian president announced a special military operation to demilitarize Ukraine. Minutes later, missiles/air raids hit all of Ukraine, including Kiev, shortly followed by a massive ground invasion from several directions, in a major escalation of the 2014 conflict and resulting in the siege of several major strategic Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mariupol, and Sumy. The Ukrainian president has since enacted martial law resulting in the general mobilization and management of the country by the military. While the eastern part of the country was attacked from the beginning of the invasion with an assault on the main cities of the country, the Russian troops quickly attacked the capital, Kiev, causing the displacement of the diplomatic bodies of the United Nations and the majority of humanitarian actors to the west, particularly to Lviv, which has become a real humanitarian hub. The populations forced to flee for safety are seeking to reach the west of the country, which is, so far, still relatively unaffected by attacks.
